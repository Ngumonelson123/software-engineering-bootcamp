# Data Structures â€“ Checkpoint Algorithms
![Portfolio Screenshot 1](data-structures.png)
This project contains solutions for two algorithmic problems using arrays in Python.  
The problems demonstrate working with distinct elements of sets and performing vector operations such as dot products.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements

**Description:**  
Given two sets (arrays), find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given sets, but not in both.  

**Example:**  
- Set 1: `[3, 1, 7, 9]`  
- Set 2: `[2, 4, 1, 9, 3]`  
- Distinct elements: `4, 7, 2`  
- **Output:** `13`
